# Title of your Project: Project Proposal 

**TODO**: Edit this file. Your project proposal goes here.

Your proposal should address the elements in the [Design Brief](xxx) in a holistic manner.

The project, including **P01: Project Proposal**, is not so much about collecting specific points; rather, we ask you to be a **responsible innovator**, **coder**, and **critical thinker**. We can't tell you precisely how to take on these roles - but we know that you'll learn to do so. 

**Please note**: We understand this is hard project. Also, we understand that your ideas about the project might not completely worked out and are developing. So, we ask that you do the best you can. You will get constructive feedback from your TA and we are confident that you'll succeed! 

Here is some specific information that we expect you to have in the project proposal. You should format your report using Markdown, seeking a professional presentation - clear, concise, interesting, and free of spelling and grammatical errors. Use headings, bullet lists, and tables effectively.
