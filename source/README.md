# The `/source` Directory

All of our project code is found in this directory.  We further organize our code into 
these sub-directories: 

|Source Directories | Brief Description|
|---------------| -----------------|
|[xxx](./xxx) | Description ... 
|[xxx](./xxx) | Description ... 



# NOTES: 
* All source code for your projects should go in the `/source` directory
* To organize your code, you might decide to create sub-directories, which is fine.
* If you use sub-directories, plese breifly describe them
