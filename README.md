# Final Project Repository
**INFO-201: _Foundational Skills For Data Science_ (Winter 2022)**

*P01: Project Proposal*: [Project Proposal Title](./docs/p01-proposal.md) 

|Project Directories | Brief Description|
|---------------| -----------------|
|[`/data`](./data) | All project datasets should be stored and documented here. For example, if you work with Common Separated Value (.cvs) datasets, they would stored here and documented in this directory's README.md file. Similarly, if you get data from web APIs, you would document the APIs in the directory's `README.md`.
|[`/docs`](./docs) | All project reports and web documents will be published from this directory. This includes Mardown files (.md), R Markdown files (.Rmd),  HTML files (.html). In short, `./docs` is the root directory of the website for your project. It will also be used to store all of your design work and project documentation.
|[`/source`](./source) | All for your R source code will be located in this directory. To organize your code, you might also decide to create sub-directories.
| .gitignore | This  file is important. It tells git to ignore all files that are listed therein. See Freeman and Ross (2019, section 3.6) for details. 
| LISCENCE | This is a straigtforward software liscence that basically says "You own the copyright of your code.  Others can use your code, so long as they cite that they are doing so." If you would like to use a different liscence, that would be fine! 

### Developer notes: 
* You will use this repository for developing your Final Project. At first, some parts of this 
initial project set-up will likely be confusing. Please don't worry, because during lecture/lab 
during weeks 5-8 you will learn everything you need to know. 
* Your first project deliverable, **P01: Project Proposal**, should be written in Markdown and stored in the file: `./docs/p01-proposal.md`
